# Hourly Schedule

The application will display an hourly planner with the current date displayed on top of the calendar. As the user scrolls down, they will be presented with a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. time block and as the user views the schedule, the time blocks will be color-coded to represent: gray for the past, red for the current hour, and green for the future. As the user clicks on a time block they will be able to enter an event and if they save with the save button on the right of that specific time block the text will be saved into the local storage and if the user refreshes their page, the event will still be displayed.
